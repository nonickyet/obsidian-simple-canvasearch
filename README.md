# Obsidian Simple Canvasearch Plugin

Just install, set a shortcut for the search modal action, then you can use it to fuzzy-search and navigate within your canvas page.
# Settings
You can search note titles only or include note contents in the fuzzy search, but this can potentially slow you down if your canvas is very large as it is not optimized at all. 


# Using
Actually forked and updated for myself and don't want to spend time publishing it into the community plugins.
But if you find it useful, you can install it manually by following the instructions below.
 - Clone this repo
 - Run `npm build` to build the plugin
 - Create empty folder(name isn't important) in obsidian plugins folder
 - - you can find the path to the plugins folder in Obsidian(Settings -> Community plugins -> Installed plugins -> Folder icon) 
 - Copy the `main.js` and `manifest.json` files from the project to your folder 
 - Reload Installed plugins in Obsidian(Settings -> Community plugins -> Installed plugins -> Reload icon)
